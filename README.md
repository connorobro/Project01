üìÑ Project 01: Job Listing Application
Final Submission & Retrospective

üîó Link
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/connorobro/Project01 

üìù Overview
Our group developed a Job Listing Application designed to help users search and manage job opportunities. The application supports:
User registration and login


Profile editing (username & password)


Job search by category


Saved jobs tied to individual users


View saved jobs for each profile


Database access for stored user/job data

üìñ Introduction
Communication: We coordinated using Slack. Weekly updates and code reviews were handled via GitHub pull requests.


Stories/Issues Considered: About 12‚Äì15 initial stories were outlined (registration, login, saved jobs, API integration, styling, profile editing, testing).


Stories Completed: Nearly all major stories were completed, including login/registration, profile editing, job search, and saved jobs.

Issues:
#17 Interest Selection
#22 User Profile
#11 Home Page Screen


Role / Stories Worked On:
I worked on the homepage, which included the Saved Jobs button, the user profile dropdown menu, and the interest selection dropdown menu. The Saved Jobs button leads the user to the saved jobs page. The user profile dropdown menu displays the logged-in user‚Äôs name and provides options to either update the profile or log out. Lastly, the interest selection dropdown menu is populated using our API, allowing users to choose a job category and click the search button, which then directs them to the job page.


Biggest Challenge:
Testing was hands down the hardest part because Jest was frustrating to work with. It was tedious and difficult to get the tests to run on my computer, and it felt unnecessary to test whether elements were rendered correctly. Another challenge was integrating the API into our project without exposing it. I was unfamiliar with API keys, so figuring out how to securely use GitHub secrets and environment files was difficult.


Resolution:
I was able to get a few test cases to work by installing the correct dependencies, such as @testing-library/react-native, and using utilities like fireEvent, render, screen, and waitFor. For the API keys, I looked at an old project I had worked on and used it as inspiration. I first installed react-native-dotenv and then imported it into the page where I was calling the API. I created a .env.local file in the project‚Äôs root directory and added the keys like this:
EXPO_PUBLIC_ADZUNA_API_KEY=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_ADZUNA_APP_ID=...
Following the React Native Expo documentation, I then used them in my API URL as: https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/us/categories?app_id=${process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ADZUNA_APP_ID}&app_key=${process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ADZUNA_API_KEY}


Favorite Part:
I enjoyed making the buttons, writing the code to make them functional, and building the overall layout. I also liked figuring out how to implement the API and creating the user profile page, where I debugged and tested different ideas‚Äîsuch as when to allow users to edit, and how to handle password and username changes.


Redo:
If I could redo something, I would improve the testing to make it more robust. I would include more cases, such as checking edge cases in functions and ensuring proper element rendering.


Lesson Learned:
I learned that React Native does not handle website creation and database storage as easily as I initially thought. We wanted to use SQLite, but due to the configuration requirements, we decided to use AsyncStorage instead, which worked well since we primarily wanted to test the app on the web rather than on an emulator. I also learned how to work in an agile environment: doing everything through pull requests, conducting code reviews, merging, and participating in standups. These practices helped us stay aligned and understand where we were in the process.

Role / Stories Worked On: 
I implemented the Jobs page, which dynamically populates with results based on the user‚Äôs selected job category. I also designed and built the Saved Jobs page, including the feature where clicking the heart icon on the Jobs page adds that job to the user‚Äôs Saved Jobs list for later reference.


Biggest Challenge: 
The biggest challenge was ensuring that saved jobs persisted properly across app restarts and were saved uniquely per user. Initially, jobs were either lost on reload or shared across all users, which broke the intended functionality.


Resolution:
I restructured how jobs were stored and tied them to individual user sessions. I also updated the logic for local storage/database handling so that saved jobs were retained even after the application restarted.


Favorite Part: 
My favorite part was designing  and styling the Jobs page and the Saved Jobs page was my favorite part. I enjoyed making them both visually appealing and functional, and it was especially rewarding to see them fully working together ‚Äî users could search, save, and return later to review opportunities they liked.


Redo:
If I could do it again, I would set up persistence and per-user saved jobs earlier in development to avoid delays in testing and debugging.


Lesson Learned:
I learned how React Native could be applied to create the features we wanted, and how to resolve merge conflicts in GitHub so code could be successfully integrated into the main branch. I also learned how to collaborate effectively in a group setting to build an end product, while improving my debugging skills and approach to designing user-friendly pages.

Lesson Learned:

‚úÖ Conclusion
Project Success: We set out to create a functional Job Listing app, and we successfully implemented user login/registration, job category search, saved jobs, and profile editing.


Largest Victory: Achieving saved jobs persistence unique to each user and integrating job search smoothly.


Challenges: GitHub collaboration was tricky at first (merge conflicts, PR reviews), but this helped us improve version control practices.


Final Assessment: The project was successful in meeting our goals, and we gained valuable teamwork, GitHub workflow, and full-stack development experience.
